# Single price grid component
This project was created based on a Frontend Mentor [https://www.frontendmentor.io/] challenge. The layout and design idea come from Frontend Mentor, while the code implementation is my own.

## 📦 Technologies
- HTML5 — semantic markup for clear and accessible structure
- CSS3 — styling and layout
- CSS Grid — main layout structure
- Flexbox — alignment of elements inside sections
- BEM methodology — consistent and maintainable class naming
- Media Queries — responsive design for different screen sizes
- Google Fonts (Karla) — typography

## 💻 The Process
This project was my second attempt at building this responsive page. During the first attempt, I struggled to understand how to make the layout flexible, especially because it required using `CSS Grid` — a topic I wasn’t confident with at the time. I decided to pause the project and focus on learning Grid basics.

I watched a series of educational videos (by `Net Ninja` - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrLN2YId-5M&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9itC4TxYMzFCfveyutyPOCY&index=10), which helped me better understand how CSS Grid works and how to apply it in real layouts. After that, the concept became much clearer, and I felt confident enough to return to the task.

I restarted the project from scratch with a new approach. First, I gathered all the necessary resources provided for the challenge (design files, styles, and guidelines). Then I built the main HTML structure using semantic markup. After that, I moved on to styling — starting with the mobile layout and then adapting the design for desktop using CSS Grid and media queries.

Once the layout was complete and responsive, I finalized the styles and published the project to `GitHub`.

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to build `responsive layouts` using CSS Grid and define rows and columns for different screen sizes
- How to combine `CSS Grid` and `Flexbox` effectively for layout and alignment
- How to structure HTML using semantic elements for better readability and accessibility
- How to apply the `BEM methodology` to keep class names consistent and maintainable
- How to approach a layout by starting with `mobile-first` design
- The importance of stepping back to learn core concepts when something is unclear, instead of forcing a solution

## 🚀 How It Can Be Improved?
- Add more accessibility improvements, such as better color contrast, focus states
- Improve reusability of styles by introducing CSS variables for colors, spacing, and font sizes
- Refactor the layout to reduce repetition in Grid positioning and make the CSS more scalable
- Implement JavaScript functionality (for example, form validation or interactive feedback) to make the component more dynamic
